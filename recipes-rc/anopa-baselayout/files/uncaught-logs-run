#  The -p option is important:
# even if s6-svscan is told to kill everything,
# you do not want this logger to die.
#  The -b option ensures s6-log processes lines one
# at a time, so it doesn't eat up too much memory
# in case of a problem spike.
#
# Note that, when running under anopa, we actually don't want the -p, because
# anopa shuts down carefully
